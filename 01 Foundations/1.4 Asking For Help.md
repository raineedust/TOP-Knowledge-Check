# [Knowledge Check](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/asking-for-help#knowledge-check)

- [Name at least one thing your question should always include.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/asking-for-help#provide-code-knowledge-check)
- [Describe the “XY Problem”.](https://xyproblem.info/)
- [Describe three attributes of a “help vampire”.](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/)

1. Provide context of the problem, nail down the specifics.
2. The “XY Problem” occurs when:
   A user asks for X, assumes that Y is the solution to their problem. They asks about how to do Y, realizes that their problem did not get solved. After much unneeded interaction, everyone realizes they needed help with X and not Y.
3. Not willing to Google, expects others to do the thinking for them, spams questions impatiently.
