1. A network is a bunch of electronic devices connected to each other through a medium, such as Ethernet cables.
2. The Internet is just a network that connects all computers across the world.
3. An IP address is an identifier for network devices, such as computers or routers. This serves as a way to identify where data packets within the same network gets sent to.
4. A router receives all data packets from the network, then routes them to the correct machine based on identifiers like IP address.
5. An ISP is a company that manages a bunch of routers connected to other ISP routers to receive and send data across the entire network.
6. Packets are large chunks of data divided into smaller pieces, so that:
   - In case one of them is corrupted, it is easier to replace.
   - It can be routed along multiple paths, allowing content to be downloaded to multiple devices at the same time.
7. A client is an end-user device capable of connecting to the Internet, allowing content to be downloaded.
8. A server is a computer that provides content to be downloaded, e.g. webpages, videos, images for clients.
9. A web page is a HTML document displayable from an internet browser, containing assets such as:
   - Stylesheets, which controls how a page looks and feels
   - Scripts, which add interactivity to the page
   - Media, such as images
10. A web server is a computer hosting website(s). By hosting, it means it provides all the webpages in a website downloadable for other devices.
11. A web browser allows you to visit websites by requesting for assets to be downloaded through web servers.
12. A web service on a site that indexes the entire web and ranks them through an algorithm, allowing you to access the websites it predicts you are looking for.
13. A DNS query sent by a device to a DNS server in order to obtain the IP address given a domain name.
14. Chrome 96.
15. The entered query gets sent to Google servers, and it figures out what you most likely are looking for based on an algorithm.
