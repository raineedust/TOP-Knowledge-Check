1. Use `git init -b main` to initialize a local directory as a Git repo, or create one from GitHub’s UI.
2. Use `git clone <git address>`.
3. It’s **origin**.
4. `origin` is the default remote connection name.
5. `main` is the default branch name.
6. First, you can stage your changes, sort of like asking them to be in a waiting room. Then you save a snapshot of all your changes by committing. All the snapshots can be retrieved back at a later time when necessary.
7. Use `git status`.
8. Use `git add`.
9. Use `git commit -m "msg"`.
10. Use `git push origin main`. Make sure SSH or HTTPS authentication is set up.
11. Use `git log`.
