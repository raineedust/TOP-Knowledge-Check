1. `<a>element</a>`
2. An attribute gives extra information to an element, starting with a value and ending with a name.
3. The `href` attribute.
4. Absolute links contain the protocol, domain, and path of a destination.
   Relative links contain only the path, as it navigates relative to the directory of the current HTML file.
5. `<img>element.png</img>`
6. The `src`(specifies image location) and `alt`(img description, useful for screen readers) attributes.
7. `<img src="../images/element.png">`
8. `.jpg .png .svg .gif`
