1. - External CSS are defined from a separate file and linked back from the HTML file using the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="<file>` tag.
   - Internal CSS are defined from the `<head>` section of the HTML file. May be useful for rules styling a single page.
   - Inline CSS are embedded into the HTML elements, w/o using selectors. Generally bad practice.
2. - Class selectors have a period followed by a class [[The Odin Project/4.6 Links and Images|attribute]].
   - ID selectors have a hashtag followed by an ID attribute. Used sparingly.
3. Use a Grouping selector, which has a comma-separated list of selectors.
4. Chaining selectors
5. It will cause elements that match the last (as in the last one, LTR) selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector.
6. Class selectors have higher specificity than type selectors.
