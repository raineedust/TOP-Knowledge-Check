1. Padding, border, margin
2. Use an alternative CSS box model from the standard.
3. The difference lies in whether the width and height of an element includes its padding and border. In order to ensure the alternative is always used, we can set the box-sizing property on the `<html>` element:
   ```css
   html {
     box-sizing: border-box;
   }
   *,
   *::before,
   *::after {
     box-sizing: inherit;
   }
   ```
4. `margin`
5. `padding`
6. `margin`
