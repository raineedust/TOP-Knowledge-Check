- [What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?](https://javascript.info/operators#numeric-conversion-unary)

1. `let`, `const`, and `var`.
2. `var`, as it has unpredictable behavior.
3. - Names contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`.

- First char. cannot be a digit.
- Bonus: Remember they’re case-sensitive.

4. When `+` applied to strings, it concatenates them. When it’s applied to both str and num, the concatenation takes place when it’s compiled, with LTR priority.
   `alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"`
5. It outputs the remainder of an operation.
6. `==` is equality, `===` is non-equality. Bonus: `=` is an assignment operator and not a check for equality.
7. When doing arithmetic w a non-numeric string.
8. `var++ or var = var + 1`
   `var-- or var = var - 1`
9. In prefix form, we can only use the new incremented value for the next operation. This is the opposite case (un-incremented) for postfix form.
10. Operator precedence defines the priority of operators when there are multiple of them in one expression. Unary operators are higher than binary ones.
11. Ctrl+Shift+I > Console
12. `console.log()`
13. Unary ops will convert them to numbers. This isn’t the case for binary ops.

## [Variables Assignment](https://javascript.info/variables)

1. `let admin, name; name = "John"; admin = name; alert(admin);`

2. `let ourPlanet = 'Earth'; let currentVisitor = 'Jerry';`

3. Uppercase for `birthday` but not `age`, as age isn’t a hard-coded value, but instead calculated on runtime.

## [Operators Assignment](https://javascript.info/operators)

1. `a`=2
   `b`=2
   `c`=2
   `d`=1
2. `a`=4
   `x`=5
3. Solution
   1. 10, as `""` converts numbers into string.
   2. -1, as `-` only works with numbers, so `"-1"` converted to numbers.
   3. -95
   4. -14
   5. 1, as `null` is +0.
   6. `NaN`, as `undefined` = `NaN`, and anything + `NaN` = `NaN`.
   7. -2. `\t`, `\n` are whitespace chars, so it’s an empty string, where converted to number = `0`.
4. Convert strings to numbers by prepending them with unary `+`.

```js
let a = +prompt("First number?", 3);
let b = +prompt("Second number?", 2);
alert(a + b); // 12
```

## TOP Assignment

```js
1;

console.log(23 + 97);

2;

console.log(2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12);

3;

let sol = (4 + 6 + 9) / 77;
let solRound = sol.toFixed(5);
console.log(solRound);

4;

let a = 10;
console.log(a);
console.log(9 * a);
let b = 7 * a;
console.log(b);

5;

const max = 57;
let actual = max - 13;
let percentage = actual / max;
```

# Notes

- JavaScript uses the `+` operator for both addition and concatenation. This results in deviation of behavior compared to other operators, e.g. `-` or `*`, as they will always try to convert strings to numbers when it contains numeric operations.``
