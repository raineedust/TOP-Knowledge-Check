1. - `number`
   - `bigInt`
   - `string`
   - `boolean`
   - `null`
   - `undefined`
   - `object`
   - `symbol`
   - `typeof`
2. `object`, as it can contain more than one value.
3. `null` is for undefined values, `undefined` is for unassigned values.
4. Backticks are for concatenation, single/double quotes are strings syntax
5. Concatenation
6. Backticks
7. `Do this:``
8. `\`
9. Methods are predefined ways to work with strings.
10. `substring()` doesn’t accept negative indexes, `slice()` does. `substr()` treats the first parameter as string position, but second parameter as length.
11. `||` OR, `&&` AND, `!` NOT
12. Greater/less than, Greater/less than or equals, equals, not equals
13. Truthy values become `true`, falsy values, such as false, 0 , -0 , 0n , "" , null , undefined , and NaN are `false`
14. They allow the code to perform different actions based on different conditions.

17. `( condition ) ? run this code : run this code instead`
18. Putting statements inside another one.

## [Data Types Assignment](http://javascript.info/types)

1. hello 1 // hello name // hello Ilya

## [Comparisons Assignment](http://javascript.info/comparison#tasks)

1. true // true // false // true // false // false // false

## [Logical Operators Assignment](https://javascript.info/logical-operators#tasks)

1. 2. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy (i.e., except for false , 0 , -0 , 0n , "" , null , undefined , and NaN)
2. First 1, then 2. Alert calls aren’t truthy (they’re undefined=falsy), thus the operator evaluates the next value. 2 is truthy and the operator stops.
3. null. `&&` operator is the opposite of `||`, as it finds the first falsy value.
4. 1, then undefined. Alert calls are undefined=falsy.
5. Since `&&` have higher precedence, the operation executes first. We get `alert( null || 3 || 4 );` since all values are truthy, and it returns the last operand. OR operator stops and returns value at 3 (truthy).
6. `if (age >=14 age <=90)`
7. 1. `if (!(age >=14 age <=90))`
   2. `if (age <14 || age >90)`
8. 1. -1, truthy
   2. 0, falsy
   3. `if (null || -1 && 1)` becomes `if (null || 1)` as -1 and 1 are truthy, operator will return the last operand. 1, truthy is the final result.
9. [Logical Operators Task 9](https://codepen.io/raineedust/pen/qBVWWMy)

## [Conditional Branching: If, '?' Assignment](https://javascript.info/ifelse#tasks)

1. No, value is falsy.
2. [Conditionals Task 2](https://codepen.io/raineedust/pen/RwjNOpP)
3. [Conditionals Task 3](https://codepen.io/raineedust/pen/VwrYNdL)
4. `let result = (a + b < 4) ? "Below" : "Over";`
5. [Conditionals Task 5](https://codepen.io/raineedust/pen/ZEaYZPV)
