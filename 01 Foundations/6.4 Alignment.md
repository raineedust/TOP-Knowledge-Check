- [What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items`?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container)
- [How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container)
- [Whatâ€™s the difference between `justify-content: space-between` and `justify-content: space-around`?](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

1. Declaration `justify-content` deals with the main axis, while `align-items` deals with the [cross axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross_Axis), which is perpendicular to the main.
2. Using the following declarations to position items on the main axis as well as cross axis:
	```css
	.box {
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	}
	```
3. `space-between` spaces everything in between evenly, while `space-around` spaces everything evenly with equal spaces around the first and final block.
