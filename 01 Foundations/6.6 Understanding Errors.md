- [What is the key difference between an error and a warning?](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/understanding-errors#errors-vs-warnings)
- [What is one method you can use to resolve an error?](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/understanding-errors#tips-for-resolving-errors)

1. A `TypeError` may be thrown when:
   1. an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;
   2. or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;
   3. or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.
2. Errors pause the execution of programs, while warnings are not necessarily code-breaking but should ideally be addressed early.
