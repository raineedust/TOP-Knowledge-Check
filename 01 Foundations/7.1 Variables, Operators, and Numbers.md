- [What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?](https://javascript.info/operators#numeric-conversion-unary)

1. `let`, `const`, and `var`.
2. `var`, as it has unpredictable behavior.
3. - Names contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`.
   - First char. cannot be a digit.
   - Bonus: Remember they’re case-sensitive.
4. When `+` applied to strings, it concatenates them. When it’s applied to both str and num, the concatenation takes place when it’s compiled, with LTR priority.
   `alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"`
5. It outputs the remainder of an operation.
6. `==` is equality, `===` is non-equality. Bonus: `=` is an assignment operator and not a check for equality.
7. When doing arithmetic w a non-numeric string.
8. `var++ or var = var + 1`
   `var-- or var = var - 1`
9. In prefix form, we can only use the new incremented value for the next operation. This is the opposite case (un-incremented) for postfix form.
10. Operator precedence defines the priority of operators when there are multiple of them in one expression. Unary operators are higher than binary ones.
11. Ctrl+Shift+I > Console
12. `console.log()`
13. Unary ops will convert them to numbers. This isn’t the case for binary ops.

## [Variables Assignment](https://javascript.info/variables)

3. Uppercase for `birthday` but not `age`, as age isn’t a hard-coded value, but instead calculated on runtime.

## [Operators Assignment](https://javascript.info/operators)

1. `a`=2
   `b`=2
   `c`=2
   `d`=1
2. `a`=4
   `x`=5
3. 1. 10, as `""` converts numbers into string.
   2. -1, as `-` only works with numbers, so `"-1"` converted to numbers.
   3. -95
   4. -14
   5. 1, as `null` is +0.
   6. `NaN`, as `undefined` = `NaN`, and anything + `NaN` = `NaN`.
   7. -2. `\t`, `\n` are whitespace chars, so it’s an empty string, where converted to number = `0`.
