1. A JS [object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) that can hold multiple values in a list-like format.
2. To hold multiple values in a single variable.
3. Refer to its index number in another variable.
4. Assigning a different value to an index number.
5. `constructor`, `length`, `prototype`.
6. `toString()`, `shift()`, `splice()`.
7. Doing the same thing over and over again.
8. It exits a loop.
9. It skips to the next iteration of the loop.
10. Able to know if your code works correctly without having to execute it, which is more efficient.

## Loops: While and for Tasks

1. With each iteration, the code checks for condition of `i`. Since i=`0` is falsy, code only executes at `i=1`.
2. In prefix form, `++` increments `i` and returns the new value, while postfix does increment but does not return the new value. Both loops do not `alert` the same value, but instead 1 to 4 for prefix, while 1 to 5 for postfix. This is because, for the postfix loop at `i=5`, it returns the old `i=4` value for the condition and as such proceed with the execution.
3. Both loops: 0 to 4
