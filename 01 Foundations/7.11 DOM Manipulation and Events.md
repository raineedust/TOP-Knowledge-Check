1. A tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage converted from HTML.
2. Use CSS selectors and combinators.
3. Example: `document.createElement(tagName, [options])`
4. Example: `parentNode.appendChild(childNode)`
5. Example: `parentNode.removeChild(child)`
6. Example: `const div = document.createElement('div');`
7. `textContent`, as `innerHTML` have security risks.
8. The JS file only runs when specified in its HTML counterpart file.
9. Events are actions triggered by users. Listeners react based on those user actions, such as playing a video after a mouse click (event).
10. 1. Attach functions’ attributes on your HTML elements
	2. Set the `on<event>` property on the DOM object in JavaScript
	3. Use event listeners
11. It’s more flexible, as multiple events can be implemented.
12. Reduce code redundancy, making it more readable.
13. Get a nodelist of items matching a selector with `querySelectorAll('selector')`, then use `.forEach` method to iterate through every button and add listener.
14. `querySelector` only returns the first match of a selector, while the `All` selector returns a nodelist.
15. It references all the matches of the selectors.
16. Capture means a function is run each time going all the way down a nested element. Bubbling is the opposite, as the function runs while going up.
