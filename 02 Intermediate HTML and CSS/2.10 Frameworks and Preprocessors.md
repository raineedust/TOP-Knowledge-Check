1. Frameworks typically have ready-made documentation, and they help developers make design decisions, which they might be otherwise unqualified to make.
2. Websites may look too similar to each other, and technical debt is introduced.
3. They provide extensions to vanilla CSS such as nesting, mixins, and variables.
4. Debugging is harder, and the generated CSS files during production may be large.
