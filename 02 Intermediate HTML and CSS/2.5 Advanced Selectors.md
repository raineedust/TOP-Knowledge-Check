1. Descendant combinators will only select **direct** children. So if you use `div > p`, but `p` is not directly under `div`, and instead another element like `h2`, it won’t be selected. See [CSS Child vs Descendant selectors - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1182189/css-child-vs-descendant-selectors).
2. Pseudo-class selectors are prefixed with a single colon, while it’s two colons for pseudo-elements.
3. Pseudo-classes select HTML elements through states or relative positions, while pseudo-elements do not actually exist, but “adds” onto existing elements.
4. We could use `.div:nth-child(2n)` or `.div:nth-child(2n + 2)`.
5. They match elements that are the first or last sibling, respectively.
6. `:hover` and `:active`, respectively.
7. Use `[attribute="value"]`.
8. Use `[attribute^="thunder"]`
