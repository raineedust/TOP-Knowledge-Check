- [What is the difference between `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`?](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-advanced-grid-properties#auto-fit-and-auto-fill)

1. Use `repeat()` function.
2. Dynamic means it can be shrunk or expanded as necessary.
3. Using fractional units.
4. Use a different `fr` unit for different columns. Example: `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 2fr) repeat(3, 1fr);`.
5. `min()` and `max()`
6. `minmax()`
7. `clamp()`
8. `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`.
9. The difference lies in that for `-fill`, the grid items come down to `min` size, as opposed to `max`, when the grid can fit another item which doesn’t exist.
